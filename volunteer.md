## Volunteer

#### We _need_ you to volunteer!

Very simple, there's no-one employed, every participant, also the organizers pay for their ticket. We're in this boat together and we can make it conquer the seas or crash into a big ice cube. It's really up to us.

So we need you to lend a hand. Please consider volunteering at least 1 time. Please take into account that most shifts don't require constant work. For example a kitchen shift is usually counted at 3 hours, but most of it is 'being there'.

There are countless other ways to get involved, including:

* Arriving early for build or staying after for clean up
* Helping to transport stuff there
* Creating and bringing art
* Running a workshop
* Making music, a show, or a performance
* But you can create your own way to participate!

### There are 3 types of angels:

You can belong to **one** or **many** of them.

#### Kitcheneer

Provide food and drinks to people, You help in the kitchen or behind the bar.  
**You chop, slice, peel, heat, distribute and clean.**  
Give a smile to people with the power of your good vibes combined with drinks and snacks.

#### Production

Making stuff happen, **moving things**, rigging things.  
But also, **cleaning**, improvising.  
**Work smart, not hard.**

#### Support

Welcome committee and greeters, crowd control, tent oversight.  
Nudging people to do the right thing is your thing.  
You know **a smile accomplishes more than a grumble**.  
Candidates must agree to put on a fluorescent jacket.

### What if there aren't enough volunteers?

Well, then the food won't be set up, the place won't get cleaned en nothing gets done. But we can still go outside to lay down in a puddle of mud. :-\)

### How To register?

Initially we set up a fancy volunteering website platform, but on second thought, this is overkill. Another platform to sign-up on, complex screens with shifts etc... Now the plan is to put a big paper schedule on the wall where you can write your name on to pick a shift you like.
