# Unconference

Maybe we can do some kind of semi formal knowledge-exchange/peer-learning?

Four easy rules for unconference sessions

* Rule one: Whoever shows up are the right people.
* Rule two: Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
* Rule three: Whenever it starts is the right time.
* The fourth and final rule is: It’s over when it’s over.

## Todo now: Un-conference

We'll follow the classical un-conference format with post-it notes. Think ahead:

* what are topics/subject you'd like to see covered or would like to know more of? 
* What are topic, subjects, workshops or activities you'd like to share with others?
