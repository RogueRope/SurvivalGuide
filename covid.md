# COVID

It's too soon to make solid predictions. The assumption is that, like in 2020, contact-sport activities will be allowed in bubbles of 50 people. We'll see how it evolves over time. 

To give you some idea, we take the situation seriously and operate within the boundaries set by the law. This is **not** an illegal gathering.

## Protocols (info from 2020, needs update)

We're following 2 protocols:

First one is the protocol for events. These where tightened 26/7, lowering the capacity to 100 people inside and 200 outside, which is well beyond our capacity of 49. We did the [official event scan](https://www.covideventriskmodel.be/) and we got a green label.

The second protocol, is related to sport stages. We define Shibari/Bondage as a type of bodily exercise. In sport, bubbles are defined as 50 people. Here we follow the [current guidelines for sport](https://www.sport.vlaanderen/corona-en-sportbeoefening-in-vlaanderen/).

This also means we follow the [Protocol for sport](https://www.sport.vlaanderen/media/13719/protocol-voor-sportkampenvolsen.pdf) for adults and seniors as defined by Sport Flanders.

## Some of the Covid changes
* Move everything outside
* There's no more buffet, you will go to a counter choose what you want, and take this outside.
* The 2 shower rooms will only be used one couple at the time.
* Doors will stay open, alco-gel everywhere, ... 
* The darkroom is canceled. :-(

## Some basic tips/rules/measures:

We'll take our own precautions, here's to hoping for good weather so we can use the outside space as much as we can.


* **Always** have your mask _with_ you, we will provide some masks for you if you forgot. Maybe some situation will arise where the org decides it's strictly necessary and you will be asked to put it on. If such a situation should arise, you should be able to put it on.
* Respect people's boundaries, we'll take the 1.5 meter rule as a guideline, if you want to deviate from that, you ask the persons involved. This also implies keeping distance when queuing for stuff.
* We will take temps of all visitors, but this does unfortunately **not** mean everyone is healthy and we can go lie in a big pike exchanging fluids. Asymptomatic people can still transmit. 
* Furthermore we've taken different steps to lower chances of infection. 
* We do take things seriously, **we're not having an illicit zero-fucks-given party in the woods**, but a legit, small scale, corona-proof event.
* We've asked you to bring a mug, now we also urge you to bring your own personal knife, fork and spoon. 
* If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact the orga people. 

## Alternative Approach

It's perfectly OK to camp with us, explore the neighborhood with your partner and return in the evening for the open air social distanced rope jam. Plenty of stuff to look at and enjoy. 

## In case of symptoms: stay home!

* Checklist [dutch](https://www.horeca.com/nl/corona) / [English](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)
* **NEW:** _**Ticket refund**_**.** If you have a doctors advice telling you to quarantine, **ask to get it in writing**, forward this to the org and we'll refund the ticket of you _and_ your partner. It's the least we can do.
