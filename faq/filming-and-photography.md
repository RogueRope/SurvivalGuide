# Filming and Photography

## For all of us

Always get consent before you film or photograph someone at Rope Camp.

**Never film or photograph someone without their express consent.** This includes people in the background of a photo you're taking.

If that you have a dispute with someone about photography, please let the organizer know. Your right to take someoneâ€™s photo and publish it **never** over-rules their right to privacy! If posting photos onto Fetlife or other social networking sites, **MAKE 100% SURE** that **EVERYONE** featured in your photos is happy for them to be posted. You should not be tagging people online unless you have their explicit permission

If you have any questions about photography or filming at Rope Camp, please email [support@roguerope.be](mailto:support@roguerope.be)

## Do not post pictures of the campsite!

The campsite offers us privacy, so we should respect theirs. This means you are extra careful when it comes to publishing pictures where the campsite is recognizable. A tree isn't recognizable, the building, signs and interior are. Take this into account when taking a picture, but mostly posting online. Feel free to take pics of the site for personal use. 
If we spot a picture that shows clearly where the event took place we will spank your bottom and ask you to edit it or take it down. This **includes** Fetlife.

## DRONES. Can I fly my drone at Rope Camp?

Yes, but respect relevant laws and be cool.
