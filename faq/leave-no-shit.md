# Leave No Shit

## What's MOOP?

Everything you bring to the site has the potential to become **MATTER OUT OF PLACE \(MOOP\)**: costumes, water bottles, booze containers, inflatable chairs, hats, fruit, cigarette butts, even rope fibers can all become MOOP. Every person is responsible for their rubbish.

## What should I do with my rubbish?

One of the fundamental ideas of Leave no trace is : **Pack it in, pack it out**. Everything brought at Rope Camp will have to be taken away before the end of the event.

**NEVER LET MOOP HIT THE GROUND. Clean As You Go. MOOP Attracts More MOOP. When You See Trash On The Ground, pick It Up And Take It With You.**

* **Carry a MOOP bag**. Wherever you go, carry a small bag to collect any MOOP you find. 
* **Weigh items down/don’t let them blow away**: put weight on it or tie down anything that can blow away.
* If you’re a smoker, **carry a portable ashtray** such as a mint tin with you at all times. Or put butts in your pocket. **Never, ever drop butts**.
* Do not let bins overflow and MOOP get out of hand.
