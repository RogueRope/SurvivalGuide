# Emotional

Things will get chaotic at Rope Camp. For example, interacting might feel too intense at times, and/or you may feel a bit alone or alienated, without familiar comforts to rely on. But there are plenty of ways to deal with this!

Here are some tips :

* Be gentle with your body 
* Seek help if you need it 
* State your boundaries and communicate, whether talking with strangers or your loved ones 
* Have the experience that makes YOU happy 
* Connect in ways that make YOU comfortable 

## Seeking help

Please contact HansF if you need support, your issues will be addressed to the best of our abilities. I will do my best to involve the right people to find a solution, albeit by giving you private space, finding a nice person to talk to, or any other solution that could improve your situation.

Rogue rope mindset is: we never look for blame or shame, we are always focused on solutions.

## Couples

Spend all the time together you want, but leave room for yourself and your interests, too. Remember that there are many new friends for you each to meet as well, so each of you should feel encouraged to spend time with other people as well as each other. 

Still, be sure to schedule plenty of ‘dates’ together, and keep them. Just make sure that you honor your time together, but also apart.
