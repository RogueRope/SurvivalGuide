# Participation

## I’d like to help out, but honestly, I have no skills. What can I do?

At Rope Camp, we’re all volunteers, and we always need more help! Two-thirds of Rope Camp participants volunteer in some capacity during, before, or after the event. Skills are less important than a can-do attitude and the willingness to work hard. Email [info@ropecamp.be](mailto:info@ropecamp.be) to offer more general help.

When you register we will give you a work shift to help out on site, many hands make light work.

## Can I make art?

Damn right! Rope Camp encourages participants to create and contribute art.

## But I can’t build stuff or make art! What can I do?

Contribute in any way you can. You could cook, give manicures, massages, workshops or performances, and anything else that takes your fancy! Everyone has a valuable contribution to make.
