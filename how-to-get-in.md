## Buy a ticket.
The amount of participants is limited, this is because of the site and because of the Covid guidelines. The assumption is that demand will be much bigger than the supply. 

There are 2 ways to handle this: 
* The Tomorrowland way: open ticket sales at a certain time and hope for the best. Tickets sales will essentially become a lottery. 
* The meritocratic way: people who've participated before and made a positive contribution will have the opportunity to buy a pre-sale-ticket first. 

Sadly, we assume that it will be fully booked when this pre-sale is over. We were almost fully booked last year, and we give all participants a voucher. Also, the people that came as a single last year, will receive two vouchers.

Looking forward to next year, the plan is to double the available capacity, so more new people will have a chance to sign up.

## Timeline

* March: mails will be sent out with vouchers to the people that participated.
* After two weeks, vouchers will be sent to people on the [mailing list](https://roguerope.be/pages/newsletter.html).
* 

## Stay safe.

Nothing much more to do than to take care of yourselves and your loved ones. Follow the guidelines as defined by the authorities.

## Get to the location

The site is in the Lokeren area, you can get there by car, but there's also a train station a 3km walk away. You can take a bus, then it's only a 1km walk.

Our camping ground is 200m from the main road, you can drive up, take out your bags, check in, but after that you need to park your car back on the main road. Take into account: you cannot drive with your car on the camping area! So the last 30 meters or so, you need to drag your stuff.

If you bring a camper we will be able to put that on the field using our combined people-power, same goes for trailers.  


## Give your order number to the greeter.

You made it! Make sure to bring your order confirmation with the qr-code, so we can verify payment, you will get a release statement to sign.

You will get a shift of work... this could be cleaning up, going to the bakery or making sure the fire is hot, we will ask you to put your name down.

Next we will measure your body temp, if it's above 37.2 C you will be asked to leave.

If it's lower you will get a nice bracelet in return to prove you are now one of the cool healthy kids.

Now it's time to relax, set up your tent and share a drink with us.
