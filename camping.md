# Camping


It's a field, it's basic, with room for a campfire, so bring your guitar and marshmallows. We'll distribute electricity on the campsite, if you want to get hooked up bring the longest extension cord you have and a power strip. This way you can charge your mobile devices while you sleep.

Let's hope for good weather, but if it rains, **do not dig a trench around your tent**. We want to leave the field in the same condition as we've found it.

Other stuff to bring:

* Your Christmas lights!  Or other cool led strips. Let's make it funky at night.
* Toilet/shower facilities are indoor, basics, 3 toilets and one urinal, so no smelly Dixie-toilets. 
* No need to bring dodgy gas stoves or other cooking gear, we will provide you with warm food.
* Please try to limit smoking on the camp-site, fire safety is important. Keep it clean! Trow your butts in the designated ash trays.
* If your smoke smells a bit funny, that's fine, no need to hide it in your tent.
* A box cooler, or one of those supermarket insulation bags.

## Is there a possibility to sleep indoors?

There is some room inside but we'll use this for activities.
