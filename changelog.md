# What's different from last year?

## Food
* You bring your cooler, we will provide ice cubes!
* You need to bring your own booze and soda, we will still provide coffee and water.
* Breakfast: bring your own favorite bread covering (cheese/meat/jam or even pindakaas). Put it in your cooler, and we'll send someone to the bakery for fresh bread every morning.
* We **still** provide snacks in the afternoon and warm food every evening.

## Campsite
* The campsite has grown in size, so there should be enough space to pitch your tents.
* There is a little forest area to play. 
* Two words: **fire pit**!
* Such much privacy! 
* Showers! Here's the bad news: this year it's very primitive, compared to last year. Think of *one* shower-cabin with two shower heads. So shower quickly, and don't use too much water.
* No more public WiFi to cover the campsite, but 4G coverage is great.
